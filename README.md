# Car List Manager

Car List Manager is a React-based project that allows you to add car names and costs to your list. You can search for specific cars, view their total costs, and delete cars from the list. When your search term matches any car in the list, the total cost is updated immediately. Additionally, if you add a new car that already exists in your list, that car will be highlighted with bold weight.

## Usage

1. Add cars to the list by entering the car name and cost in the provided input fields. Click the "Submit" button to add the car to the list.

2. To search for a specific car, enter the search term in the search input field. The list will update in real-time to display only the cars that match the search term. The total cost will also update to reflect the costs of the displayed cars.

3. To delete a car from the list, click the "Delete" button next to the car you want to remove. The car will be removed from the list, and the total cost will be updated accordingly.

4. If you add a new car that already exists in the list, that car will be highlighted with bold weight to indicate the duplication.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
